## Data

There are 10 different datasets that each have a training set, validation set, and testing set of size 500, 100, and 100 respectively. The features available for each sample are the embeddings for the multi-omics and the drug features from the DeepCDR model. The DeepCDR model was trained on a training dataset with approximately 69,000 samples and a validation set of approximately 18,000 was used for early stopping.  The 10 different datasets can be accessed using the link [Data](https://github.com/Ved-Piyush/DeepCDR_MEnKF-ANN/tree/main/Data)
